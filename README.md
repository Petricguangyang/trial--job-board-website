# trial--job-board-website
This is a practice of using Visual Studio Code and ChatGPT to generate a website. 
I followed the YouTube link of "How I Coded An Entire Website Using ChatGPT". https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng438SIXyW4
Prompt: "I am using Visual Studio code and would like to use app.css, index.html, and app.js to generate a job board website, similar to ZipRecruiter's website. the website should include 5 mocked jobs and job descriptions at the bottom. In the search region, include "search job title", "search location",  and a "search" button. when people input information in the search region, they will click search, the website will select from the mocked job and show the job description and the job title. please help me generate"

I generated the basic website and had a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

I also tried "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOyw_M1mNE". Unfortunately, it does not work.
